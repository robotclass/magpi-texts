Hardware Development and Robotics
=================================

Gert van Loo has developed a General
Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) expansion
board for the Raspberry Pi, called the
Gertboard. The board is able to control
flashing light-emitting diodes (LEDs),
and connect to servo motors, sensors
and other electronic components.

Enthusiast 'Bodge N Hackitt' is planning
to connect a robotic arm to the USB port
and GPIO header of a Raspberry Pi.
The first part of his series of articles
entitled 'Skutter' can be found on pages
10-11.

Over the coming months we will be
following these and many other
interesting home-grown projects.
