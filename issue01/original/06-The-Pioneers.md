The story of how the Raspberry Pi computer came to be.

Cambridge and Beyond
--------------------

Cambridge University attendees have played a major role in the development of
computers in Britain. The story of how these individuals have branched out into various
organisations such as ARM Holdings plc, Acorn, Sinclair Research, Element 14,
Broadcom and the Raspberry Pi Foundation is a complicated one.

To understand the links between all of these
companies and organisations is extrememly
difficult, due to many mergers, aquisitions,
dismemberments, shareholdings,
employment movements and so forth, and
many a journalist has been beaten trying to
unravel exactly who did what, and now who
owns it.

What we do know is that the Raspberry Pi
project began in 2006. There was a common
desire amongst certain individuals to
recapture a sense of the pioneering spirit of
computing that came during the 1980s,
When affordable personal computers
became available to the average hobbyist or
budding computer enthusiast. There was a
growing concern about the diminishing
interest in computer science and an opinion
that the ICT curriculum had become too
focused upon word processing, spreadsheets
and databases.

Initially the plan was to build a simple
microcontroller-based computer that booted
straight into a python interpreter prompt
(the Pi in the Raspberry Pi name was a
reference to the Python programming
language).

This cheap device was intended to be used
to promote and invigorate the next
generation of programmers and developers.

Due to the cost of producing a working
system with networking capabilities, device
drivers, etc. built into the interpreter, it was
decided that it would be easier to use an
already freely available operating system
(Linux). Using Linux would also allow
flexibility in the choice of programming
languages and other software that could be
used.

The option of using a 'System on a Chip'
(SoC) became preferable to a
microcontroller computer. Broadcom had
developed a range of ARM processors for
use in smartphones.

Broadcom employee Eben Upton and other
luminaries such as David Braben (Famed
writer of the BBC Micro games 'Elite' and
'Frontier'), Jack Lang, Pete Lomas,
Professor Alan Mycroft and Dr Robert
Mullins set up a charity called 'The
Raspberry Pi Foundation'. The idea they had
in mind was to design a SoC board
populated with a Broadcom ARM11
processor chip, which could be produced
and sold at a very inviting price, to a
potential new generation of computer
science engineers.

The first prototype boards were the size of a
USB memory stick, with 1 USB port at one
end and a HDMI video output at the other
end. These boards used microSD memory
cards to store the Linux operating system.
The boards were too small to accomodate a
network port, GPIO header, composite video
and analogue audio outputs, which would
mean that they were unsuitable as hardware
development boards.

It was decided that a credit-card sized
board would be sufficient, and the
Raspberry Pi Foundation set about
designing the board layout and working
with the Linux community to develop and
refine a number of Linux operating system
distributions that would work well with the
700MHz ARM1176JZF-S processor. The
initial design had an SD card reader fitted
to the underside of the printed circuit
board (PCB), however the first prototype
card readers protruded slightly outside the
credit card shape.

In August 2011, fifty alpha boards were
produced. The SD card reader had been
repositioned to be flush with the edge of
the card.

By December 2011, beta boards of the
Raspberry Pi were able to demonstrate Full
HD 1080p video playback and a ported
version of the Quake 3 game, using the
onboard Videocore IV graphics processing
unit (GPU).

Notably the beta boards were fitted with
micro-usb power connectors. This meant
that it would be possible to use the
commonly found phone chargers to power
the boards

In January, The Raspberry Pi Foundation
auctioned some of their prototype
Raspberry Pi boards on Ebay and
announced that the first 10,000 Raspberry
Pi computers were being manufactured in
China. They would be sold through
industrial components suppliers 'RS
Components International' and 'Premier
Farnell' with additional design engineer
community support provided through
'Element 14'.

After a few setbacks, the first Raspberry Pi
boards were available for pre-order. The
official launch was at 6am UTC on the
29th of February 2012.
